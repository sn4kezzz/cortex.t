## Introduction

**IMPORTANT**: If you are new to Bittensor, please checkout the [Bittensor Website](https://bittensor.com/) before proceeding to the [Setup](#setup) section.

## Setup

### Before you proceed
Before you proceed with the installation of the subnet, note the following:

We **strongly recommend** before proceeding that you test both subtensor and all API keys. Ensure you are running Subtensor locally to minimize chances of outages and improve the latency/connection.

### API Key Requirements

API requirements for this subnet are constantly evolving as we seek to meet the demands of the users and stay up to date with the latest developements. The current key requirements are as follows:

- OpenAI key (GPT)
- Google API key (Gemini)
- Anthropic API key (Claude3)
- Groq API key (Llama, Gemini, Mistral)
- AWS Acces key and Secret key (Bedrock models)
- Pixabay API key

Please test the API keys from ```.env.example``` with ```test_scripts/t2t/``` before starting the miner/validator. Detailed instructions on how to aquire the API keys below.
